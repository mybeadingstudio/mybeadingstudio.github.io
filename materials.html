                    <p class="text-justify">These tiny rounded beads are used for the majority of bead-weaving and embroidery projects and 
                        can be used for multi-strand jewelry. They come in various colors, 
                        finishes and sizes. The higher the size number, the smaller the bead, 
                        because the the size number refers to the number of beads that can fit along an inch.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="well well-lg text-center">Crystal Beads</p> 
                    <p class="text-justify">Crystal beads are made from glass with a high lead content, 
                        which increases the sparkle when the facets are cut. 
                        This makes them more expensive but the quality is so much better.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-justify">Bugle beads are long, thin, tube-shape beads. 
                        They are also made of glass and come in many of the same finishes and colors as seed beads do. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Wood beads are inexpensive and lightweight, even when very big, 
                        so they are suitable for chunky designs. Wooden beads often have bigger threading holes than other beads, 
                        so you can use a wider variety of stringing materials.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The real pearls are usually very expensive. 
                        For beading projects, we usually use the imitation pearls. 
                        They are made of glass beads with a pearlized coating, which are more affordable and are great for fashion.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Beads made from semi-precious stones can be very expensive 
                        but using them for accent or focal point can greatly improve your design. 
                        Some stones need special care so check with the seller before you buy them. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Round nose pliers are used to make circular loops on head pins, 
                        eye pins or wire. The bottom section is used for large loops while the tips are used for smaller loops.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The jaws of these pliers have a smooth gripping surface for holding tiny objects. 
                        They are essential for gripping wire, making right angles and to open and close jump rings and loops.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">These are used to cut beading wires. 
                        The shape of the blades gives you a clean and flush cut on the wire 
                        which will make your design look neat and professional.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The jaws of these pliers have two grooves which are designed 
                        to secure crimp beads or tubes onto beading wires. </p>

                    <p class="well well-lg text-center">Flexible Beading Wire</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Flexible beading wire is made of various strands of fine stainless steel 
                        which are coated with a nylon coating. That is why they come in all sorts of fun colors that 
                        you can incorporate into your design. Usually, the weight and the design will determine the choice of wire.  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p class="well well-lg text-center">Memory Wire</p> 
                    <p class="text-justify">Memory wire is tempered wire that remembers its shape and retains its coiled form. 
                        For those who want to make wine charms or napkin rings, it is important for the wire to keep its shape.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p class="well well-lg text-center">Stretch Thread & Cord</p> 
                    <p class="text-justify">These are made of plastic. 
                        They are flexible and are used for making designs that don't need clasps. 
                        To fasten these, tie a square knot with an extra wrap and finish it with a bit of jeweler's cement.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">These also come in various colors. 
                        A very simple design for this kind of material is to hang a pendant or 
                        a single beautiful large bead from the cord or the suede. The cord ends are used to finish this kind of design.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="well well-lg text-center">Silk Cord</p> 
                    <p class="text-justify">Silk cord must be used with a needle. 
                        They are traditionally used for stringing pearls and small gemstones with knots between the beads. 
                        Knotting between beads prevents the beads from rubbing against each other. 
                        Also, if the string breaks, you will not have a disaster. </p>

                        They are the easiest to fasten and the most secure. 
                        The lobster claw opens when you pull on a tiny lever.
